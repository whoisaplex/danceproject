        <div class="main_text_image">Zumba</div>
        <div class="filler">Zumba was born in Colombia in the 1990s, quite by accident. A fitness instructor forgot to bring his usual workout music to class, so he grabbed some Latin albums from his car, ditched the constraints of a traditional workout and danced just like he would at a club. His class followed along, sweating to the salsa and rumba beats, and loving it.</div>

      <div class="box street">
        <div class="main_text_image">Street</div>
        <div class="filler">A street dance is a dance style—founded by African-Americans—that evolved outside dance studios in any available open space such as streets, dance parties, block parties, parks, school yards, raves, and nightclubs. The term is used to describe vernacular dances in urban context.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="box team">
        <div class="main_text_image">Disco</div>
        <div class="filler">In the early years, dancers in discos danced in a "hang loose" or "freestyle" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the "Bump", "Penguin", "Boogaloo", "Watergate" and the "Robot".</div>
